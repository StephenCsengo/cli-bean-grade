# BeanGrade: A Python CLI App

With specialty coffee subscription services, such as [Trade Coffee](https://www.drinktrade.com/), it can be difficult to keep track of all the different coffees you've tried. BeanGrade is a CLI application that allows multiple users, such as everyone in a household, to keep track of and rate coffees from specialty coffee roasters.

BeanGrade allows you to create users, add coffees, and rate these coffees. Additionally, coffee and ratings can be deleted or updated as needed. The app uses SQLAlchemy to persist changes to a database.
